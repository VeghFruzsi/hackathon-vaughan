Hi!
Hello!
Ciao!
What's up?
How are you?
What about you?
I'm fine.
I'm tired.
Everything is ok.
What is your plan for today evening?
Nothing special.
I will meet with my mom.
I will go to the cinema with my sister.
I would like to go out with my friends, would you like to come with us?
No, thanks.
It's a good idea, but I have to learn for tomorrow.
Oh, yes, I would.
Bye!
Bye-bye!
See you!
Ciao!
